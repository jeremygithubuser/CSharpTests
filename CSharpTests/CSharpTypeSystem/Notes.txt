struct 
class
delegate
interface


Keywords 

1/ keyword struct is used to create Types that inherits from System.Value.Type (special abstract class)
Example : the System.Int32 type was is created (or declared) by the struct keyword 

2/ keywords like : int , double , long , bool ... are use to alias Types like System.Int32
, System.Double , System.Int64 , System.Boolean. 
They were created with the struct keyword so they are evaluated on the stack

3/ keyword enum is used to create Types that inherits from the System.Enum Type (abstract class)
Are they evaluated on the stack?

4/ keyword class is used to create Types that inherits directly System.Object (class)
they are evaluated on the heap

5/ keyword delegate is used to create Types that inherits from System.MulticastDelegate (special abstract class)
they are evaluated on the heap

6/ interface keyword is used to create Types

7/ keyword array is used to create or Hold instances of Type System.Array (special abstract class)
they are evaluated on the heap

8/ Type is also a Type of System.Type that overides System.Object Equals Method.


notes: special abstract class are not sealed but can not be inherited by user
